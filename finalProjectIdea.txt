Name: Data Library

Elevator pitch:
 The Data Library will be built with basic semantic UI elements. This application will show how easy it uses a React component and read a set of items from a NYTimes API.
 This will make a request to fetch the items and then add them to the state after receiving the response. The items can be filtered and listed in multiple pages.
 
Dependencies:
 - react
 - react-dom
 - react-router-dom
 - react-scripts
 - NYTimes API
 - enzyme

Tasks need to be done:
 - Setup create-react-app scaffold
 - Deploy the Libarary app onto a web server
 - Create the Library page and call the API to print the results
 - Store the API results in React component state
 - Build filter feature
 - Build pagination feature

Plan for 3 weeks:
 - Week 1: 
   - Setup create-react-app scaffold
   - Deploy the Libarary app onto a web server
   - Create the Library page and call the API to print the results
   - Store the API results in React component state
   - Utilize CSS and images (Phase 1)
 - Week 2: 
   - Build filter feature
   - Build pagination feature
   - Utilize CSS and images (Phase 2) 
 - Week 3: 
   - Perform some basic user testing
   - Clean up and remove debugging messages
